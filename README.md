# secure3270proxy
This is a system to authenticate users (over TLS optionally) on 3270 terminals and then show them a list of mainframes they can connect to

For TLS, you will need to provide your own .crt and .key files from, say, let's encrypt. or generate your own. 
  
Secure3270proxy uses the racingmars go3270 library as well as his proxy3270 stuff. Thanks, @racingmars
